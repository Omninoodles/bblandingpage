                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Third-Party Services</strong>
                    <p>The App may contain links to or integrate with third-party services, such as Google Sign-In or Firebase. These services are governed by their own terms and privacy policies. We are not responsible for the content or practices of these third parties, and your interactions with them are at your own risk.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Updates and Maintenance</strong>
                    <p>We reserve the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the App or any part of it without notice. While we aim to minimize downtime, there may be occasions where access is interrupted for updates or maintenance. We will not be liable for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the App.</p>
                </li>
                <li>

                    <p>In the future, we may offer subscription services or in-app purchases. These services will be processed through the iOS App Store (and, eventually, the Google Play Store) in accordance with their respective terms. All payments and refunds will be handled directly through these platforms, and we will not be responsible for payment processing or related issues.</p>
                </li>

                    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your data.

                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Dispute Resolution</strong>
                    <p>In the event of a dispute, you agree to resolve it through binding arbitration rather than court proceedings. This agreement to arbitrate applies to all claims and disputes related to the use of the App, except for matters involving intellectual property rights or where arbitration is prohibited by law.</p>
                </li>
                <li>

                    <strong>Changes to These Terms</strong>
                    <p>We reserve the right to update or modify these Terms at any time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last updated" date at the top of these Terms. Your continued use of the App after any changes indicates your acceptance of the new Terms.</p>
